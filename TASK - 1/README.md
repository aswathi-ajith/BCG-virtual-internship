# Investigating Customer Churn at PowerCo

This project focuses on understanding and addressing customer churn for **PowerCo**, a leading gas and electricity utility provider for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With increasing competition and a dynamic energy market, PowerCo is experiencing significant customer attrition, driven by factors such as pricing sensitivity, alternative energy options, and other service preferences.

## Key Objectives
1. **Formulate the Problem**: Translate PowerCoâ€™s churn issue into a well-defined data science problem, focusing on identifying factors influencing customer decisions.
2. **Identify Data Requirements**:
   - Customer demographics and historical purchasing trends.
   - Pricing structures and competitive pricing comparisons.
   - Business location, size, and energy consumption patterns.
   - Customer feedback, complaints, and satisfaction scores.
3. **Analyze and Visualize**: Use data analysis techniques to test hypotheses and provide actionable insights.

## Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigate relationships between churn and influencing factors, such as pricing sensitivity and customer satisfaction.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Use heatmaps, scatter plots, and trend analysis to highlight correlations and outliers in customer behavior.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to forecast churn likelihood and identify at-risk customer segments.

## Expected Outcomes
The findings from this analysis aim to provide PowerCo with strategic recommendations to:
- Reduce churn by targeting high-risk, high-value customers.
- Optimize pricing strategies to improve customer retention.
