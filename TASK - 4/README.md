# Executive Summary: Customer Churn Analysis at PowerCo

## Objective
This project focuses on identifying drivers of customer churn for **PowerCo** and developing actionable strategies to mitigate churn through data-driven insights. Leveraging **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **predictive modeling**, we aim to assist PowerCo in improving customer retention and enhancing profitability.

## Key Metrics and Insights
1. **Churn Prediction Accuracy**: The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 82%, identifying non-churn customers effectively but requiring further refinement for churned cases.
2. **Critical Drivers of Churn**: Key features influencing churn include:
   - **Net Margin**: Indicates profitability per customer.
   - **12-Month Consumption**: Reflects usage patterns correlated with customer retention.
   - **Price Sensitivity**: Metrics such as the difference in off-peak prices between December and January.
3. **Model Impact**:
   - **Improved Focus on Retention Strategies**: Insights allow PowerCo to identify high-risk customers and prioritize interventions.
   - **Profit Optimization**: Addressing churn for high-value customers could significantly impact the bottom line.

## Recommendations
1. **Optimize Pricing Strategies**:
   - Adjust seasonal pricing to mitigate customer churn driven by cost concerns.
   - Develop loyalty rewards tailored to high-consumption customers.
2. **Advance Feature Engineering**:
   - Incorporate time-based trends, such as peak-hour consumption patterns, into the analysis.
   - Integrate external economic indicators to understand broader customer behavior influences.
3. **Enhance Model Precision**:
   - Prioritize improving recall rates for identifying at-risk customers to minimize false negatives.
   - Experiment with diverse machine learning models and refine hyperparameters for better performance.
