# Churn Prediction and Revenue Optimization Project

In this project, we have undertaken a comprehensive approach to optimizing revenue and customer retention by analyzing churn probabilities and the impact of offering discounts based on these predictions. This involved several key steps:

## 1. Exploring Churn Prediction Models

We began by understanding the concept of churn prediction, focusing on using probabilistic models to estimate which customers were likely to churn. We employed these churn probabilities to determine the threshold for offering discounts. By adjusting the cutoff value, we examined how the choice of cutoff affects the revenue delta, i.e., the difference in revenue between the intervention (offering discounts) and the base case (no discount).

## 2. Analyzing the Impact of Minimum Revenue Constraints

As we introduced a minimum revenue threshold, we observed how targeting only customers above a certain revenue value impacted the overall results. While this approach reduced the number of customers eligible for discounts, it allowed for a more focused strategy that prioritized higher-value customers. However, this did not always result in the highest revenue delta, demonstrating the importance of balancing customer value with churn probability.

## 3. Forecast vs. Actual Churn Data

The real insight came from using forecasted churn probabilities rather than actual churn outcomes. By leveraging a predictive model to estimate churn, we were able to simulate future scenarios more accurately. This approach led to the highest revenue delta, showcasing the value of predictive analytics in designing more effective retention strategies.

## 4. Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization

We explored the effect of varying the cutoff values and tracked the revenue delta for different scenarios. The analysis revealed that the maximum benefit came from adjusting the cutoff and using forecasted churn probabilities, highlighting that focusing solely on historical churn data can be limiting. We also recognized that while higher-value customers often warrant more attention, targeting a broad customer base can sometimes yield greater overall revenue due to the sheer volume of customers impacted.

## 5. Strategic Implications for Business Decisions

Throughout the project, we kept in mind the trade-offs involved in targeting all customers versus focusing on high-value ones. While targeting all customers might seem inefficient in terms of revenue per customer, it could still deliver higher overall returns. On the other hand, focusing on high-value customers based on churn predictions may improve profitability but require careful consideration of the intervention's cost.

## Conclusion

The project has demonstrated that the key to optimizing churn reduction strategies lies in using accurate, forecasted churn data and adjusting discount thresholds intelligently. It also showed the importance of considering both customer value and churn likelihood when designing retention strategies. Forecasting churn probabilities instead of relying on actual churn data offers a more robust and profitable approach, ultimately ensuring that businesses can retain the most valuable customers while minimizing unnecessary discounting. 

The results suggest that combining predictive analytics with a well-calibrated cutoff strategy is the most effective method to maximize revenue and customer retention in this context.
